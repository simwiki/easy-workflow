#       # The shortest interval you can run scheduled workflows is once every 5 minutes.
#       # Note: The schedule event can be delayed during periods of high loads of GitHub Actions workflow runs. 
#       # High load times include the start of every hour. 
#       # To decrease the chance of delay, schedule your workflow to run at a different time of the hour.
#       # Every 20 minutes.
#       # - cron: '*/20 * * * *'
#       # triggers the workflow every day at 9:18 UTC
#       - cron: "18 9 * * *"
